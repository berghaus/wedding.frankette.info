Guests who have time to explore the area before or after the celebration are very welcome to contact us for recommendations in this respect.

Nice family excursions are for example a visit to the [German Museum](https://www.deutsches-museum.de/en) or the Schloss Nymphenburg Park with the [Mensch und Natur Museum](https://mmn-muenchen.snsb.de/).
If the weather is really nice, a better option may be the Isar or the [Garching lake](https://www.muenchen.de/freizeit/seen/garchinger-see) nearby for a swim.

At the research campus Garching (where Frank and Babette work) you can also find the [ESO Supernova Planetarium](https://supernova.eso.org/germany/) including a very exciting exhibition. approximately 30 min by foot from Garching centre (or via Bus/Ubahn)
